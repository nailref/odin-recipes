    <p>This recipe makes the most delicious, juicy, and tasty slices of pork - perfect for a traditional Danish <br> Christmas dinner! And our favorite part - the pork crackling on top - is crispy and crunchy, adding an <br>amazing savory taste and texture to the dish.</p>
    <p>This is the recipe for a traditional Danish roasted pork with a crisp rind. In Denmark this roast is called <br>a Flæskesteg which translated simply means a pork roast and it is typically served during Christmas. <br>However, many people also have it for dinner all year around. In many countries, a pork roast <br>is normally prepared without the rind. In this Danish version the rind is always left on and then it is <br>cooked into crisp and salty cracklings. In Denmark, you can get this piece of meat in every grocery <br>stores. Outside Denmark, you properly need to contact you local butcher to get a cut where the rind is <br>left on the meat.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 kg Boneless pork roast with rind</li>
            <li>coasre salt</li>
            <li>5 dried bay leaves </li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Use a sharp knife to cut long deep grooves in the rind of the pork roast. The grooves should be <br>about 5 mm (1/5 inch) apart. Make sure to make deep grooves in the rind but do not cut into the <br>actually meat.</li>
            <li>Rub the entire roast thoroughly with coarse salt. Especially, make sure that you get lots of salt in <br>the grooves.</li>
            <li>Place 3-6 dried bay leaves in the grooves - this can be omitted if you do not have any.</li>
            <li>Place the roast on a rack with a roasting pan underneath. In the roasting pan; add 1/2 liter (2 cups) <br>of water and some sliced carrots and onions. This water with the vegetables can later be used <br>to make a nice gravy. Make sure that the roast is lying in a horizontal position. You can use <br>a ball of aluminium foil under the roast to level it. If you do not do this you risk that the rind gets <br>an uneven color or get burned.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 225 C (440 F) and cook the roast for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn down the heat to 200 C (400 F) and continue cooking.</li>
            <li>When the core temperature is 57 C (135 F) turn on the grill function in the oven. This make sure <br>that the rind gets nice and crisp. Keep an eye on the roast so that you don't burn it.</li>
            <li>The roast is done when the core temperature is 65 C (150 F). It takes about 1.5 hours to reach this <br>temperature. If the water evaporates during the cooking, you should add some extra.</li>
            <li>When the roast is done; take it out of the oven. Let it rest for about 15 minutes or eat it right <br>away. Cut the roast in slices at each groove.</li>
            <li>If you want to make a nice gravy; drain the vegetables form the water and pour it in a sauce pan. <br>Add some heavy cream and some brown gravy coloring. Add salt to taste.</li>
        </ol>
