    <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.<br>
                Add onion and cook for about 3-4 minutes. Add ground beef and increase heat to medium-high.<br>  
                Cook until the meat begins to brown, about 5 minutes.  Sprinkle with garlic powder, salt, and pepper</li>
            <li>Lower heat to low and add marinara sauce. If you want the lasagna to be extra saucy,<br>
                 I suggest adding more sauce. Let the sauce continue to simmer. </li>
            <li>In a small bowl, stir together ricotta cheese, parmesan cheese, egg, basil, salt,<br>
                 and pepper.</li>
            <li>Cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions.</li>
            <li>Spread the bottom of a 9 x 13 baking pan with 1/4 cup of the meat sauce.<br>
                Place 3 noodles in a single layers on top of the sauce.<br>
                Spread each noodle with parmesan ricotta cheese filling <br>
                and sprinkle with 1 cup of mozzarella cheese and meat sauce.  Repeat.<br> 
                Finish with remaining mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Spray a large piece of foil with non-stick cooking spray and<br> 
                cover the lasagna. Bake for 15 minutes and then remove the foil.<br> 
                Continue to bake until the cheese if bubbling,<br> 
                about 25 minutes longer. Cool the lasagna for 10 minutes<br> 
                before cutting into pieces.</li>
